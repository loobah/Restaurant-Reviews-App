### Description

This is a fully responsive website for restaurants.

Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements according to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets.

Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.

### Instructions

It is necessary to launch a local client server using Python from your terminal.

From inside the new directory, install:

Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

Visit the site in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
